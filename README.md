# Power Learn Project - CSS Basics & Box Model Assignment

## Overview
This project demonstrates foundational CSS skills by styling a structured HTML page. It focuses on basic CSS properties and showcases the CSS Box Model through padding, margin, and borders.

## Features
- **External CSS File**: All styling is contained in `styles.css`.
- **Box Model Demonstration**:  
  - Borders, padding, and margins applied to sections, feature cards, and buttons to visualize spacing.  
  - Flexbox used for layout of feature cards.
- **Styled Content**:  
  - Header, navigation, sections, cards, buttons, and footer styled with colors, fonts, and spacing.  
  - Background colors highlight content areas.
- **Clean & Readable Code**:  
  - Well-indented, organized, and beginner-friendly.

## File Structure
- `index.html`: Main HTML page with structured content.  
- `styles.css`: External CSS file with all styling rules.  

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in any web browser.  
2. Observe the styled sections, navigation, and feature cards.  
3. Inspect elements to see how padding, margin, and borders affect layout (Box Model).

## Box Model Notes
- **Margin**: Space outside the element’s border.  
- **Border**: Edge around the element’s padding.  
- **Padding**: Space inside the element, between content and border.  
- **Content**: The text or media inside the element.  

This project visually demonstrates how these properties influence layout and spacing on a web page.
